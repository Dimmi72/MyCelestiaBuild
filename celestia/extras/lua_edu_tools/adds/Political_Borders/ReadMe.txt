INTRODUCTION:
This add-on draws the political borders on Earth and shows the country names.

HOW TO USE:
This add-on was designed for Celestia 1.5.1 or later. To use it, just drop this directory
into your "extras" folder. Use one of the included CELX scripts to toggle ON/OFF the model,
or else the borders will be shown permanently on Earth (unless, of course, if you remove the
add-on from the extras directory).

LICENCE AND CREDITS:
This add-on is free and may be edited as you wish, but only if it's related to Celestia
and education. You may NOT use the model for any commercial purposes. This readme file
MUST IMPERATIVELY stay with all the files included in this addon.

Many thanks to Grant Hutchison who gave me all the necessary data to built the CMOD file.
The border data were extracted and compiled by Grant from the World Databank II and the
World Vector Shoreline datasets.

The CELX files were done by Vincent Giangiulio. Many thanks to him for this invaluable
scripts.
