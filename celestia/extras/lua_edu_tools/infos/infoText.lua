	["Milky Way"] =
[[The Milky Way, our galaxy :

 The Milky Way is a gravitationally bound
 collection of roughly a hundred billion stars.
 Our Sun is one of these stars and is located
 roughly 24 000 light years (or 8000 parsecs) 
 from the center of the Milky Way.
 The Galaxy has three major components:
  - A thin disk consisting of young and intermediate
 age stars - this disk also contains gas and is actively
 forming new stars. Dust in the disk makes it appear
 orange in the picture.Dust absorbs blue light more
 than red light and thus makes stars appear reddish.
 Our Galaxy has spiral arms in its disk - these spiral
 arms are regions of active star formation.
  - A bar of older stars (white in the COBE picture).
  - An extended dark halo whose composition is
 unknown. Since the matter in the halo does not
 consist of luminous stars, it does not show up in
 the COBE image. The existence of the dark halo
 is inferred from its gravitational pull on the visible
 matter.
